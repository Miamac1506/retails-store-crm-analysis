# Retail Stores CRM Analysis Report - Power BI

### About
  KPIM has recently deployed a new method to assist the KPIM MART retail
supermarket chain in developing effective business performance reports. This method utilizes
the PowerBI tool to create smart dashboards, providing a comprehensive view of the
company&#39;s financial performance, thereby helping the management team to easily monitor and
assess business operations. These dashboards not only organize and visually present data but
also enable the company to quickly identify factors affecting profitability, including detailed
analysis of revenue, costs, and profit by department, as well as pinpointing inefficient
expenses.
